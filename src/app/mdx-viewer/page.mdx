# Sample MDX Page

Use this page to verify Cadence MDX components work.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to write JSX directly in markdown files. You can use React components alongside markdown content.

To learn more about MDX, you can visit [https://mdxjs.com/](https://mdxjs.com/).

## Cadence MDX Components

You can use the following components to operate your workflows. MDX files with these components will work as actionable documentation, which would be ideal for 

* creating oncall runbooks, 
* building UI for internal tools, 
* automating common operations, 
* and anything more you can think of ...

### Start Workflow

### Signal Workflow

Send a signal to a running workflow with custom input data.

**Usage:**

```tsx
<Signal
  domain="<domain>"
  wf-id="<wf-id>"
  run-id="<run-id>"
  name="<signal-name>"
  input={{
    key1: "value1",
    key2: 123,
    key3: ["a", "b", "c"]
  }}
>
  Send Signal
</Signal>
```

**Props:**
- `domain` (required): Domain name
- `wf-id` (required): Workflow ID
- `run-id` (required): Run ID of the workflow execution
- `name` (required): Signal name
- `input` (optional): JSON object or array to pass as signal input
- `cluster` (optional): Cluster name

**Example:**

Try clicking the button below to send a signal (note: this will only work if the workflow exists):

<Signal
  domain="cadence-samples"
  cluster="cluster0"
  wf-id="7a9a1183-1a19-466d-89ee-7124297a874b"
  run-id="3827dd73-66f9-43a7-b14b-aff9d2149dc2"
